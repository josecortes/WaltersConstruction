<h3>Project Description</h3>
<br/>
This site is meant for the use of employees and owners of a contruction company.  The employees work in a widely dispersed area and do not go to a central work site.
The site is used for employees to enter their work hours, and for owners to pull the hours worked information.  The site can also be used for users to send messages
to each other and to allow management to send broadcast messages to all employees.
In its current state, the initial log in screen works and redirects users to a home page for owners and a home page for employees.  The database functionality is there
for log in purposes.  There are additional pages for creating/changing users in the database, but these pages should be restricted to proper users in the production
release.  Many tests have been created, and about 20 of them do not pass at this time because the site is not yet complete.
<br/>
<br/>
